# Book-Management-System
The program demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts in C++ to implement a simple book management system. The bookClass class defines the blueprint for book objects, and the main function uses this class to create book objects, add them to a vector, and perform various operations on them, such as displaying the list of books, searching for a book by title, author and removing a book from the list.
